## About the application

This application was created using React.js and Material UI libraries.
Country data is fetched from a free API (https://restcountries.com/v2/all?fields=name,region,area) and displayed in a table. Only name, region, area and independence status are shown. You can sort the data alphabetically by name in ascending/descending order, filter out countries which by area are smaller than Lithuania and filter out countries from 'Oceania' region only. On top of that, pagination was implemented to display multiple pages with 10 rows per page. 

## How to launch the application

1. Install dependencies
### `npm i`

2. Start the application
### `npm run start`
